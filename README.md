I originally struggled to get the JSON code to run, but I fixed this with help from the example code. 

My second big issue was having the code run as long as there wasn't a specific user entry. 
I originally had a while loop, but I realized that a do-while loop would suit my purposes better. 

The third issue I ran into was the text being returned was not standardazied. Unfortunately, seeing as how anyone can add to this API, I could not find a way to fix this.
Instead, I added a warning at the beginning, informing the user that they might run into this issue.
